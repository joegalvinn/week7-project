hello, 

I was quite worried coming into this project as I felt a bit lost before hand. However working htrough the steps slowly and not trying to think too big picture to start really helped.

Good points. It works! it doesn't have everything that I wanted in it but it works. I have 4 endpoints, a form, a delete button and a table, well 2 tables but I ran out of time to use them both. 
I'm very happy with my css as well. I think it fits that aesthetic that a lot of gyms go for now adays and the dark mode works throughout. I didn't include any specific media querys as i made the whole site dynamic.

I really wanted to make something that I would actually use so i'm going to try this out in weeks to come and tweek it here and there.

Bad points. I wasn't able to add comments (though the table is set up) I just mostly ran out of time. I also have just realised I forgot to change the icon so its still the vite one. 
another bad point, Render, it hates me, I keep just missing the correct way to do it, Anu and her husband helped me to figure out what was wrong. They are stars.

I've used every website under the sun to help with this project and lots of looking back through moodle and cross referencing that code with other peoples. 
I find that w3 school is my go to and I also used jacobpadilla a bit as i like the way they show how elementts responde to bits of code, such as on this example https://jacobpadilla.com/articles/responsive-font-sizing-in-css.
